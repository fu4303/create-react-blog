It seems that it is the perfect time to continue my recent [blog post series](https://create-react-app.com/category/top-10-web-dev-tools/) - Top 10 Best Web Dev Tools. Every month I will try to pick the most intriguing and handy tools that I believe are must-haves for every web developer. This time there are:

## 1). Vercel

A very impressive and easy-to-use deployment and collaboration platform for front-end developers from creators of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). Vercel enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly and scale automatically – all without any configuration. So far, I have been using it for a couple of weeks, and it really feels like a [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) on steroids.

## 2). Color Leap

Color Leap is a very beautiful and well-designed resource on the history of colors. It is perfect for looking for inspiration, so choose your favorite era and dig into its colors.

## 3). HTML DOM

A handy DOM-related knowledge database from creators of [this vs that](https://thisthat.dev/) which I mentioned [last year](https://create-react-app.com/top-15-best-developer-resources-part2/).
