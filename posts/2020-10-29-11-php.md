Literally, the other day, I finished a university course that was called [Web and Game technologies basics](https://opetustarjontahaku.lab.fi/search.php?lang=en&term=Web%20ja%20peliteknologian%20perusteet#result-21260). It included a brief introduction of the PHP, MariaDB, Linux (Bash), and some server-side interactions as well.

To be honest, I had huge prejudices about PHP as a modern programming language. So, I was surprised when I heard what language was chosen for this course. For some reason, PHP always reminded me of [times](http://www.arngren.net/) when I tried to make simple sites while going to school in early 2000. Anyway, it turned out, that in some sense, PHP is really an obsolete language with a strange syntax. But, on the other hand, it still has a large amount of code written on it and remains in demand.

The general assignment on the course was an implementation of a website, with which the user can view the price catalog of a [local liquor store](https://www.alko.fi/en/). It was also necessary that the user can be able to filter the search results in a few different ways. It was a difficult enough assignment for a beginner like me, especially given that I haven't made anything with PHP before.

To complete the assignment, I had to create a container on the school server. Install there the PHP support, PHPMyAdmin, and database ([MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)) as well as the webserver ([Lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/)). After that, I had to turn the given .csv file with the catalog into a database. Finally, when I had a working database with the right data, I could build the website using PHP. At last, I got [the result](https://old.create-react-app.com/Projects/PHP/), which meets most of the requirements, but nevertheless has certain flaws.

On the image below you can see an example of the interface.

### P.S.

As you might know, [Hacktoberfest](https://create-react-app.com/10-hacktoberfest/) is almost over. So, you understand what I mean (t-shirt).
