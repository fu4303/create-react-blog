It is time to continue my new blog post series - Top 10 Best Web Dev Tools, which I [started](https://create-react-app.com/18-top-10-web-dev-tools-03-2021/) almost one month ago. Every month I will try to pick the most intriguing and handy tools that I believe are must-haves for every web developer.

## 1). Daily Dev

The best coding news aggregator I have seen so far (yes, including [Hacker News](https://create-react-app.com/15-best-developer-resources-in-2020/)). Available both as a [web app](https://app.daily.dev/) and [extension](https://r.daily.dev/chrome).

## 2). HTTP Cats

A hilarious API that you can use in your website to show funny error messages. For those who are not in the team cat, there is also a [dog version](https://httpstatusdogs.com/).

## 3). Ray.so

A super cool tool that helps you create some good-looking content for your blog or social media. I will definitely use it the future posts.

## 4). JSitor

[Last month](https://create-react-app.com/18-top-10-web-dev-tools-03-2021/) I mentioned Stackblitz, which is a great online code editor for web apps. This time I would like to present a tool with a bit narrower application, which is nevertheless very useful when working with JavaScript.

## 5). Can I use...

I suppose there must be at least one pick from captain obvious every month. This time it is a widely known resource - Can I use...

## 6). VIM Adventures

In fact, this is not a tool but an online environment that allows you to learn VIM in a game-like manner. As for this topic, I may as well recommend the [Vim Fundamentals](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/vim-fundamentals/) course by Frontend Masters.

## 9). Grid Cheatsheet

It is another useful cheat sheet, presented in visual and easy to interpret form. From the authors of [Flex cheatsheet](https://create-react-app.com/18-top-10-web-dev-tools-03-2021/) (pick number 10).
