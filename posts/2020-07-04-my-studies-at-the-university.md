As I mentioned in [one of my previous posts](https://create-react-app.com/creare-react-app-blog/), I am currently studying IT at the LAB University of Applied Sciences (Finland, Lahti). The first year of my studies ended about one month ago, and in the coming fall, I will continue with the second one.

During the first year, we had basically a lot of core studies, like English, math, and physics, which is, I think, quite common. Fortunately, we also had some courses on more IT-related topics: web development (HTML, CSS & JS), basics of software engineering (Python, SQL), servers, virtualization, etc.

Anyway, after the first year, we will need to choose our study path more precisely. So, as you can see from the picture below, every student has a lot of options to choose from. The point is to choose 7 modules (except the lower module and also the thesis and internship). Each module worth 15 credits and to graduate you need to complete 240 credits in four years. At the moment, I have 90 credits, so I guess it is pretty realistic.

I tagged some modules, about which I decided to take them: Web and game dev, Software engineering, Web services, and Mobile and game dev. There are also four modules about which Iâ€™m not sure yet. You can choose from a lot of inspiring subjects, for example, data analysis and machine learning. At the same time, I am trying to concentrate more on web development related things. So, maybe it is not a very productive strategy to go for too many things at the same time. In any case, I still have time to think about it.
