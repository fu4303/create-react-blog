As you might know, at this time, there is an event called [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Hacktoberfest is a month-long (October 1 - 31) open-source virtual festival organized by companies such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html), and [Dev](https://dev.to/villivald). It is quite a popular event among aspiring developers and all kinds of people who are interested in contributing to the open-source. Taking part is easy enough. After registration, you only need to submit four pull requests to any [GitHub](https://github.com/villivald) repo with the `hacktoberfest` topic or label. People that are maintaining repos, in turn, can create issues with such labels and wait for the contributors.

### Pull requests

I did both. First and foremost, I started by figuring out what the heck is a pull request. I mean, I used GitHub a lot before, but somehow it went past me. I was familiar with pushing, pulling, commits, repos, branches, and so on, but I have never used pull requests in my projects. Anyway, it turned out that it is quite a simple procedure. So, after some digging of information, I have already made my first pull request. You can see it in the picture below.

My pull requests may not be the most useful in the world, but I tried my best. The primary purpose was to try new technologies and to learn new skills. Among other things, I implemented a [dropdown menu button](https://github.com/imyjimmy/hacktoberfest-app/commit/56b8f75d8cb30dd1dc79112b6afda6e06b61ddd5) with the React Bootstrap library. Later I have also added [some information](https://github.com/GHATAK123/Javascript-Interview-Cheatsheet/commit/2a8769b87dff9b43120e3560119cc5ced00a0861) about using [data types in JS](https://create-react-app.com/javascript-data-types/) to the JavaScript Interview Cheatsheet repository.

### Issues

At this point, I realized that I have no idea what is the issue, so I started to think in that direction. After all, I opened one issue on each of my two most active repositories - [React website](https://github.com/villivald/proj_react_2020) and [Todo App built with React Native](https://github.com/villivald/todo_app_react_native_2020). You can see the essence of the issues in the pictures below. I was pleasantly surprised by the responsiveness of the community, and I'm very grateful to the people who helped me with the issues.
