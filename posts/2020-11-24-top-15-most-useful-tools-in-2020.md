This post was inspired by Wes Bos and his brilliant project - [https://uses.tech/](https://uses.tech/) in which I recently [participated](https://proj.ninja/uses). So, today, I would like to tell you about some tools and software that I use on a daily basis. Here we go, Top 15 Most Useful Tools in 2020.

### 1). Notion

I would like to start with the Notion, which is almost an ideal tool for organizing things. It feels like Evernote on steroids. I could definitely recommend a [Notion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66fN1cZadPA) to anyone who likes planning and getting duck in a row.

### 2). Todoist

![todoist](images/todoist-1024x810.png)

Simply the best todo app that I have ever tried so far. Runners-up: [Google Tasks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-tasks-get-things-done/id1353634006), [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), [Microsoft Todo](https://to-do.microsoft.com/).

### 3). Spark

I never really liked the standard Gmail app. I mean, it is ok, and I use it a lot, but on the other hand, I was always looking for a better alternative. I did use [Newton](https://newtonhq.com/) for a couple of years, but then it became paid, and I switched to Spark. That decision was just right.

### 4). Endel

![endel](images/endel-1024x698.png)

For me, the Endel was an absolutely surprising and unexpected choice since I have never used any musical apps on a daily basis. Well-designed, energetic, but calming.

### 5). Grammarly

![grammarly](images/Screenshot-2020-11-24-at-13.19.51-1024x499.png)

Grammarly improves the quality of my texts by **a lot**. Must have for writers. Even the free version (that I actually use) is very impressive.

### 6). Pocket

![pocket](images/Screenshot-2020-11-24-at-13.21.46-1024x582.png)

A Pocket is an ultimate tool for saving things for later. I have been using it for years.

### 7). VS Code

![vs code](images/Screenshot-2020-11-24-at-13.22.31-1024x507.png)

The one IDE to rule them all, I guess?

### 8). Nova

![nova](images/nova-1024x830.png)

A new trendy IDE from creators of [Coda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(web_development_software)). Quite pricey, but absolutely adorable.

### 9). Pocket Casts

![pocket casts](images/Screenshot-2020-11-24-at-13.23.52-1024x563.png)

I truly like podcasts, and I have tried a lot of podcast apps, like [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/), [Apple Podcasts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029), [Castbox](https://castbox.fm/), and so on. Anyway, I feel that the Pocket Casts app is the most elegant, simple, and powerful.

### 10). Transmit

"The gold standard of macOS file transfer apps" - as it described on its [official website](https://panic.com/transmit/). By the way, it is the same company that created Nova.

### 11). OneNote

![onenote](images/Screenshot-2020-11-24-at-13.27.07-1024x511.png)

One of the best applications for handwriting on a tablet. A little bit too high an entry barrier at the beginning, but it is worth it.

### 12). Strava

![strava](images/Screenshot-2020-11-24-at-13.26.04-1024x565.png)

It is time for coming out. I am a statistics nerd, so I really love this kind of apps allowing you to record and store training data. Strava goes even further, it is more like Instagram for sports, not one more boring stats app.

### 14). Calendars 5

![calendars 5](images/Screenshot-2020-11-24-at-13.28.42-1024x565.png)

Respectively, the best calendar app. Unfortunately not available for desktop.

### 15). Tweetbot

![tweetbot](images/Screenshot-2020-11-24-at-13.29.00-1024x657.png)

I am an old user of Tweetbot, the first time I heard about it in 2011. I still did not found anything better.
