Today I will continue my [Top 15 series](https://www.create-react-app.com/tags/top) with a brief overview of the best developer resources that I use daily. It is worth saying that there are a lot of great resources that are left behind the brackets. [Dev.to](https://dev.to/villivald), [Medium](https://create-react-app.medium.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/villivald), and many more obvious ones.
