It feels like it is finally time for my current situation overview after the long break since I published my [previous post](https://dev.to/villivald/16-the-15-best-developer-resources-in-2020-part-ii-2igo) in mid-December.

During the last couple of months, there were a lot of things happening, so there was not enough time for writing at all:

1. The chaotic movement to a new apartment in early January. Note to future me: please do not ever move again in the wintertime without a truck or, at least, something larger than an Opel Astra.

2. Keeping a 1-year streak by going to the gym four times a week + cycling + running sometimes. I can assure you it is possible, but not very easy when you combine it with work and studies.  
   ![Alt Text](https://reverent-carson-67c52e.netlify.app/static/img/images/v5g0nfm812mjk9hxwqpm.png)
3. Looking for a new job (still with no result) and study (112/240 ECTS). Taking part in many job interviews and university courses.
4. I also improved my [webpage](https://proj.create-react-app.com/) a lot, and added new pages, such as [Books](https://proj.create-react-app.com/books) and [Courses](https://proj.create-react-app.com/courses).

5. Lighthouse score went from the â€™50s to almost 100 in all categories. I made a PWA version as well.

6. As for my website, I started the migration to Typescript, which does not make a lot of sense at the moment. Anyway, I hope I will see the difference as the website grows.

7. I finished [Front End Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/villivald/front-end-libraries) at FreeCodeCamp. It was fun, and the information I got feels useful, except it seems to me that Redux is not something I am going to use a lot.

## What I am doing right now:

1. Besides my major university studies, I also started to [learn](https://proj.create-react-app.com/courses) Typescript at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/).  
   ![Alt Text](https://reverent-carson-67c52e.netlify.app/static/img/images/uxy4cl1cf2jna47tgh99.png)
2. I also took one [React-related course](https://www.lyyti.fi/p/CampusOnline21_Websovelluskehitys_ja_NoSQLkannat_7210) from the [Savonia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.savonia.fi/en/homepage/) via [CampusOnline](https://campusonline.fi/), but not sure if I have enough time to finish it.
3. In addition to that, there are a lot of different courses at my university right now: [Audiovisual technologies](https://opetustarjontahaku.lab.fi/search.php?lang=en&term=TE00BV49-3001#result-19481), [3D Modelling](https://opetustarjontahaku.lab.fi/search.php?lang=en&term=TE00BV49-3001#result-19479), [Game Design](https://opetustarjontahaku.lab.fi/search.php?lang=en&term=TE00BV49-3001#result-19480), [Software engineering and architecture](https://opetustarjontahaku.lab.fi/search.php?lang=en&term=TE00BV49-3001#result-19472), [Data structures and algorithms](https://opetustarjontahaku.lab.fi/search.php?lang=en&term=TE00BV49-3001#result-19473), [Software maintenance and testing](https://opetustarjontahaku.lab.fi/search.php?lang=en&term=TE00BV49-3001#result-19475), and [Java Course](https://opetustarjontahaku.lab.fi/search.php?lang=en&term=TE00BV49-3001#result-19474).

## My plans for the next couple of weeks/months:

1. The next blog post, which will be in a form of Mega JavaScript CheatSheet. It would be something like [this Markdown cheat sheet](https://old.create-react-app.com/Projects/Cheatsheet.md), which I did a couple of weeks ago just for myself.  
   ![Alt Text](https://reverent-carson-67c52e.netlify.app/static/img/images/yg5syxm7ev4gb0afroxc.png)
2. New [Top 15](https://dev.to/villivald/series/9717). I have found so many new tools and resources, that I just need to share them.  
   ![Alt Text](https://reverent-carson-67c52e.netlify.app/static/img/images/ka6ke6e5rltgn00o92yq.png)
3. I am looking forward to learning some new inspiring technologies, such as Next.js and Vue. I also would like to improve my current knowledge of JavaScript and React.
4. And last but not least, an active search for a new IT-related job continues.
