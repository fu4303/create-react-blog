Well, it's been over two weeks since the start of my vacation. Before it started, I thought I was going to [write here](https://create-react-app.com/) more often, but there were many other things and so on. Due to the coronavirus situation, it was almost impossible to travel anywhere except within the country. So we had a couple of car trips inside Finland (Tampere, Lahti, JÃ¤rvenpÃ¤Ã¤, Kirkkonummi, etc).

Anyway, my self-learning continues and I could say that I'm getting more familiar with JavaScript and React. There will be a separate post fully dedicated to React in a few days (I hope).

But let's get back to the point of this post. In the last few days, I've been working on a minor JS project. I was trying to make a simple JS Minesweeper game. So, there is the [result](https://proj.create-react-app.com/Projects/MineSweeper/index.html). At the moment, the game works to some extent, but I guess it still needs a couple of improvements.

I noticed a few lags, especially this applies to the corners of the map where it occasionally behaves weirdly. In the near future, I will try to fix them and, I suppose, I will also make some changes to CSS as well.

You can try the game (and see my other projects) by clicking one of the links below:

[https://villivald.github.io/proj/](https://villivald.github.io/proj/)

OR

[https://proj.create-react-app.com/](https://proj.create-react-app.com/)

P.S. You can also find the code at my [GitHub](https://github.com/villivald/proj/tree/master/Projects/MineSweeper).

P.P.S In the current version of the game the winning is possible, but let's say, quite unlikely ðŸ™ƒ.
