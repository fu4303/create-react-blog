Today I would like to start my new blog post series - Top 10 Must-Have Web Dev Tools. It will be partly a continuation of my last year's series ([WP](https://create-react-app.com/tag/top/) / [DEV](https://dev.to/villivald/series/9717)) but not quite. The reason for the appearance of this idea is that recently I have accumulated a huge number of links that I would like to share with everyone. I plan to do similar reviews once a month and hope these lists will be useful to someone. So, let's start with March 2021 edition.

## 1). Squoosh

Squoosh is the most intuitive and good-looking image compression web app I have ever seen. It works very fast and supports many formats (AVIF, WebP, JPEG XL, etc.).
