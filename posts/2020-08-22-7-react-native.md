In the last few weeks, I was a little tired of learning React and JavaScript. Therefore, I decided to try some new things. I do not know if it is a negative impact of that notorious "JavaScript fatigue". In any case, there are also good sides. At least I widened my horizons a bit by learning new technologies.

First, I took a [Design for Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/) course by [Sarah Drasner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahdrasner/) from the FrontendMasters. It gave me some inspiration to implement alternative approaches in the design of web applications. I have also refreshed my knowledge of Grid and CSS in general.

Then I had a brief (very brief) look at the [Svelte](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svelte/) course by [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris) himself. I find Svelte to be a very promising and intriguing framework, and I will definitely go back to learn it when I will have more time.

Further, I was interested in React Native because of its flexibility and the option to develop both Android and iOS applications at the same time. That way, I started with a [React Native](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native-v2/) course by [Kadi Kraman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadi-kraman-922a7277/). This course was good enough for starting with React Native, but on the other hand, it was too short and left me with a lot of questions and concerns. For that reason, I bought an Udemy [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) course by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-schwarzm%C3%BCller-66b152a5/), which is much more complete and comprehensive.

At the moment, I have passed about 20% of the course (it is 30+ hours long). I also made my first React Native App, which is a to-do app, just like my last [React project](https://create-react-app.com/react-todo-app/). I will try to develop it during the course, and my goal would be to make a simple and useful application with a clear design. Currently, the code of the project can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/villivald/react_native_todo_app).
