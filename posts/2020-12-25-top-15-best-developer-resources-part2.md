Today I will keep up my [Top 15 series](https://create-react-app.com/tag/top/) for the last time this year. This post will be the second part of [one of my previous posts](https://create-react-app.com/15-best-developer-resources-in-2020/), which was also related to Best Developer Resources. I wasn't originally planning any "sequels". Anyway, the reason for writing the second part is simple enough - there are just so many great resources that I want to share. This time, I will go with a bit less obvious ones, and, despite the lack of big names, I believe that there are enough noteworthy hidden gems here.

## 1). this vs that

It is a website with a simply genius approach. Explains the difference between things like :active vs :focus (CSS), class vs id (HTML), for ... in vs for ... of (JS), and so on.
